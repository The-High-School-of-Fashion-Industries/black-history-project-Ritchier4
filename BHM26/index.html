                Marie van Brittan Brown was born in Jamaica, Queens on October 22, 1922. She worked as a nurse and her husband was an electronics technician and they both worked long, irregular hours. Because of this, she found herself at home alone frequently in a neighborhood where crime is prevelant.

                Marie van Brittan Brown's invention, the home security system, was sparked by her need to feel safe and comfortable to be alone in her own home. The system allowed her to know who was at her home and contact the authorities as soon as possible if needed. It consisted of three peepholes at different heights on the door, a camera and a monitor to see who was at the door, and a voice component that allowed Brown to communicate with the person outside. If the person seemed to be an intruder, Brown would be able to contact the police with the push of a button.
                <h2>A lasting mark</h2>
                Brown's invention laid the foundation for modern home surveillance and smart security technology made later on. Brown's invention is still used in many homes and small businesses. Her invention has saved thousands of lives and prevented the endagerment of millions. In addition, her invention led to more people feeling safer and more comfortable in their own homes, especially in high crime rate neighborhoods.
